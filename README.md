# Jamnagar Agro Industries (JAI) Website Redesign

This project involves the redesign and responsiveness fix for the Jamnagar Agro Industries website. The specific focus was on modernizing the UI, fixing layout issues on mobile/tablet devices, and ensuring a consistent user experience across the `About`, `Wholesale Spices`, and `Home` pages.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the project locally:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sagar1329/jai_assignment.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd jai_assignment
    ```

3.  **Launch the Website:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. No complex build steps or dependencies (npm/yarn) are required as this is a static HTML/CSS/JS site.

## Browser Compatibility Notes

The website has been tested and optimized for the following browsers:

*   **Google Chrome:** Latest Version (Verified responsiveness and layout)
*   **Mozilla Firefox:** Latest Version
*   **Microsoft Edge:** Latest Version


**Key Features Tested:**
*   **Responsiveness:** Verified on Mobile (Portrait/Landscape), Tablet, and Desktop resolutions.
*   **Interactive Elements:** Hamburger menu, overlays, and hover effects are functional across touch and mouse interfaces.
*   **CSS Grid/Flexbox:** Used extensively for layout stability.

## Assumptions Made

*   **HTML/CSS Framework:** The project leverages a custom variation of Bootstrap (v5.1.3 structure) along with `validnavs` for the navigation menu. I assumed sticking to the existing structure was preferred over a complete rewrite.
*   **Design Consistency:** I assumed that the "Green & White" theme should be strictly adhered to for branding consistency, leading to the creation of the `.styled-footer` and specific header fixes.
*   **Assets:** It is assumed that all images located in `assets/img/` are properly optimized for web use.
*   **Placeholders:** I did not remove  placeholder images(100X100.png,1200X1350.png) as it was given in the template assuming that it will be replaced with actual images in the future.


## Time Spent on Task

**Total Time:** Approximately 8-10 Hours
